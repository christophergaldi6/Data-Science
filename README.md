## Homework 1
### Exploring and Visualizing Data

Assignment using Pandas and Numpy packages, scatterplots, line graphs, and other strategies to expand the data sets and effectively portraying them to analyze. 

## Homework 2
### Linear Regression Models

Assignment using Pandas and Numpy Packages to create linear regression models and test the accuracy of them using mean squared error, r2 score, and coefficient evaluation. Through z-scoring and variable manipulation, I was able to use the models to visualize the BMI data to predict body weight.
